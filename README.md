Immediate Steps to Take After Akira Ransomware Attack?
Disconnect Immediately
Isolate the infected machines from your network to prevent the ransomware from spreading to shared devices, servers, and backups.

Preserve Everything
Do not delete the ransom note and keep the encrypted files untouched; otherwise, the data may be lost permanently. The network traffic dumps, logs, and file hashes should also be saved for future reference.

Immediately Shut Down The Compromised Systems
Avoid rebooting the affected system as it may trigger additional encryption scripts. Also, avoid formatting the encrypted data, as you may lose your chances of successful recovery.

Contact a Ransomware Recovery Expert
Don’t attempt to DIY decryption from shady forums or unverified sources. Reach out to cybersecurity professionals as early detection can highly increase the chance of data decryption. You can reach out to our team to begin the secure evaluation and recovery process.
